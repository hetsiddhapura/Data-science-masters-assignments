    "#Q1. hat is multithreading in python? hy is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\"\"\"Multithreading is a programming technique that enables a single program to run multiple threads concurrently. Each thread represents a separate flow of execution that can perform a set of operations simultaneously. In Python, multithreading is achieved through the threading module, which allows developers to create, start, and manage threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python for several reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the responsiveness of GUI applications by separating long-running tasks from the main thread, allowing the user interface to remain responsive while the application is performing other tasks in the background.\n",
    "To take advantage of multi-core processors by splitting workloads across multiple threads to run concurrently, thereby improving overall application performance.\n",
    "To perform asynchronous I/O operations, such as reading from or writing to a file, network socket, or database connection, without blocking the main thread.\n",
    "To use multithreading in Python, you need to import the threading module and create a new thread object by subclassing the Thread class. Then, you can start the thread using the start() method, which will run the run() method of the thread in a new separate flow of execution.\n",
