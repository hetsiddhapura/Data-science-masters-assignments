    "Tuples are defined using parentheses, and their elements are separated by commas.\n",
    "Tuples can contain elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and other tuples.\n",
    "Tuples are indexed starting at 0, just like lists.\n",
    "Tuples support slicing, which means you can extract a subset of the elements from a tuple.\n",

    "In Python, a dictionary is a collection data type that stores data as key-value pairs. Each key in the dictionary maps to a unique value, similar to how words in a dictionary map to their definitions. Dictionaries are also sometimes referred to as \"maps\", \"hash tables\", or \"associative arrays\" in other programming languages.\n",

    "It is important to note that dictionaries are unordered, meaning the order in which the key-value pairs are stored in the dictionary is not guaranteed. Starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries are guaranteed to maintain the order of insertion, but it is still recommended to treat them as unordered for backward compatibility."
